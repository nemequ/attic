This is just a dumping ground for miscellaneous code that I would have
thrown away if not for this repo. Things like:

 * Partially completed stuff which I may or may not get back to.
 * Experiments, both successful and failed.
 * Things I wrote just to learn an API (possibly useful as examples).
 * Stuff without widespread appeal.
