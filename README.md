This is just a dumping ground for miscellaneous code that I may have
thrown away, or eventually lost, if not for this repo. Things like:

 * Rough drafts in need of polish.
 * Unfinished projects I'd like to get back to.
 * Experiments, both successful and failed.
 * Things I wrote just to learn an API (possibly useful as examples).
 * Stuff without widespread appeal.

If you find something in here useful please let me know; if people
are interested I'm more likely to try to do something with it.
